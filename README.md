## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Zer0day-0!

Iâ€™m a **computational biologist** with a strong focus on **population genomics**, disease informatics, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Currently, I am exploring genetic regulation in various complex diseases, specifically aiming to bridge gaps between genetic findings and public health in diverse populations.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analyzing genetic variations within populations, with a focus on the unique genetic signatures of the **north-eastern part of India** and their implications for brain and immune health.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m diving deeper into **RNA-seq**, **whole genome sequencing (WGS)**, and **variant calling** using tools like **DRAGEN** and other NGS workflows.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to **One Health** and **genome india** to explore cross-popluation disease dynamics and public health applications.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for support with large-scale genomic data processing and am always open to discussing new tools and technologies in bioinformatics.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about computational pipelines for NGS data, disease genomics, and the challenges of population-specific genomic research.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: [He/Him]
- âš¡ Fun fact: Beyond genomics, Iâ€™m fascinated by the biodiversity of the Himalayan region and the unique health traits of its populations!

Letâ€™s connect and explore the genomics of human diversity together!
